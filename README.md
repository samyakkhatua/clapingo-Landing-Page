# Clapingo Landing Page
## Hone your english speaking skills over one-on-one video call

In this project, I used React JS to build a landing page. React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially for single-page applications. It allows for the creation of reusable UI components, making it easy to build and maintain a landing page.
